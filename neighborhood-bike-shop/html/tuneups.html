        <p class="tune">Our service staff is professionally trained and certified to work on all makes and models of bicycles, not just the ones we sell. And each member of the service team participates in skill-advancement sessions with factory service techs several times each year. Whether it’s a minor tune-up or a major overhaul, you can count on us to do the job right the first time, every time.
        </p>
            
        <div id="tunesub2"></div>
        <p class="tune">When you bring in your bike for service, we always start with a free, no-obligation estimate of the work that will be needed. One of our service pros will discuss the problem with you and will carefully explain what work should be done, always respecting your choices and your budget.
        </p>  
          
        <div id="tunesub3"></div>
        <p class="tune">Getting ready to ride and discovered a flat tire? Hit a pot hole and your rim is out of true? Sometimes you can't plan when your bike needs attention. Why not bring it in? If we can fix it on the spot, we will. And if we need more time, we'll let you know when to stop by to pick it up. Come in, call or e-mail us soon so we can get your repair or adjustment completed for you and get you back on your bike.
        </p>
        
        <div id="tunesub4"></div>
        <p class="tune">If you prefer the convenience of an appointment, we will discuss with you the appropriate amount of time to plan for the service, letting you know how to plan your visit. If it’ll be ready quickly, you might want to check out what’s new in our store while you’re waiting. If you’re going to run some errands while your service is being done, consider giving us a mobile number where we can reach you in case we have any questions.
