        <p class="tune">Medical research shows that quality bicycle helmets prevent 85 percent of head injuries. Helmets made for U.S. sale after March 10, 1999 must meet the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission standard, so look for a CPSC sticker or mention of the helmet meeting the standard in the owners' manual inside the helmet box.</p>
        <p class="tune">Bicycle helmets protect by reducing the peak energy in a sharp impact. Nearly all bicycle headgear is made with expanded polystyrene (EPS) often covered with a thin plastic outer shell. Once crushed, the inner foam does not recover, which is why helmets must always be replaced after a crash. The outer shell on the helmet helps the lid skid easily on rough pavement so that it doesn't catch and jerk your neck causing whiplash or worse. Molding the EPS into the shell rather than adding the shell later is a new manufacturing technique used in some high-end models. You'll find that helmets come in many colors. If you ride at night, we recommend, light and bright colors, which are best for visibility.</p>
        <p class="tune">Fit is the most important consideration in selecting a helmet. Find one that fits snugly out of the box (not tight, though, just snug) and fine-tune the fit by adjusting the straps and adding pads where necessary to take up any space between the helmet and your head. Some head shapes require more fiddling with fitting pads and straps. Extra-small heads may need thick fitting pads. We're always ready to help with helmet adjustments. Just ask.</p>
        <p class="tune">It bears repeating that you must replace any helmet that's been crashed. Ironically, they work so well that you may need to examine them closely to spot marks or dents that indicate that you whacked your head. We have a great selection of helmets to choose from, and we're here to help with any questions you might have.</p>

        <p class="tune">PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT! Just like you practice other skills, you should practice braking, too. For example, you might pretend a car has suddenly pulled out in front of you and execute a panic stop, throwing your weight rearward as you forcefully apply the brakes. If you can train your body to react like this it's more likely to do so in a real emergency.</p>
        <p class="tune">As you ride and use your brakes, the brake pads wear slightly. You feel this as more travel in the levers and you need to adjust the additional travel out before it gets to the point of jeopardizing your braking.</p>
        <p class="tune">Don't forget to check the pad wear from time to time though. Because, if you just keep tightening brake adjustment with the barrels, you'll eventually find that the pads have worn out. To check, look at the pad surfaces. When new, most pads have grooves in them. When these grooves start to disappear, it's a sign to replace the pads. Depending on the design some are easily replaced, others require tools and know-how. We're happy to advise if you have questions.</p>
        <p class="tune">Remember that different weather conditions and riding surfaces affect braking performance. When it's raining, it's important to anticipate stops and brake early, pumping the levers to allow the pads to wipe water off the rims so they can grab and slow the bike. And, when you're riding on slippery surfaces such as sand and mud, reckless braking can cause the wheels to lock, which may throw the bike into a dangerous slide.</p>  
          
        <div id="resourcesub3"></div>
        <p class="tune">Scan the situation and make sure you've got a safe exit route in the event something crazy happens. If you can swerve into a driveway or you've left plenty of room to brake, you'll drastically reduce the chances of an accident. Drivers are under a lot of stress and they can lose it at times. You might be tempted to reciprocate. But don't because it serves no purpose and may exacerbate the situation. Instead, take a deep breath and let it go. Don't let someone else's stress rub off on you.If you intend to turn at an intersection, especially if you're moving into the left-turn lane, signal early. And, don't move left until it's safe to do so. If you get trapped on the right curb due to heavy traffic, wait until it's safe to get in the left-turn lane. Sometimes, it possible to turn right (if that road is less busy), execute a legal U-turn and use the light to proceed through the intersection the way you want to go. Always expect the worst and ride accordingly. If you can adopt this attitude at all times, you'll be safest in traffic and elsewhere.</p>
        
        <div id="resourcesub4"></div>
        <p class="tune">Probably the most important rule of group riding is good communication. Ideally, the leader will explain the ride in advance pointing out any safety considerations such as rough roads, high-traffic areas, easily missed turns, etc.</p>
		<p class="tune">f no one seems in charge, you should speak up and ask, because sometimes there is no formal leader and the assumption is made that everyone knows what's going on simply because they've come out for the ride. This is sure to cause problems. If you don't know, ask, and keep asking until you find someone who can tell you what's going on. There are always a few people who know and are willing to help and it can make a big difference in how much you enjoy the ride and how safe it is.</p>
       <p class="tune">Once the ride is underway, you can learn a lot about a group by watching the other riders. Try to find and avoid those who wobble and speed up and slow down. These are signs of poor handling skills and possible fatigue that can cause a wreck. Instead, try to ride with the people who hold a steady pace and a straight line because they're less likely to do unpredictable things that can cause mishaps.</p>
       <p class="tune">When cycling in a group, always pay attention to where your front wheel is in relation to the person in front's rear wheel. Keep your front wheel behind his rear wheel, not overlapping it. Why? Because, if he suddenly veers to avoid a hole or rock, his rear wheel will knock your front, which will send you flying.</p> 
       <p class="tune">Another extremely dangerous maneuver is turning around to look back like you might do if a friend was on the ride and you were trying to figure out where she was. There's only one safe way to look back and it requires a willing helper. To do it, ask the person next to you if you can rest your hand on their shoulder while you look back. They'll say yes and you can then hold on and look back. Having your hand on a shoulder prevents you from swerving as you look back and it keeps your bike going at the same speed as the other bikes preventing slowing that could cause problems. Practice this tactic with a single riding partner before trying it in a group.</p>
      <p class="tune">Finally, there's the challenge of expectorating in the peloton (a bike racing term for what the group is called). Everyone has to do it, so don't hold off. But, do it carefully so you don't soak your ride partners and get banned from the next ride. Always spit with the wind and away from riders. If this means steering to one side of the road first, go for it (but only when you're sure it's safe to move over).</p>
