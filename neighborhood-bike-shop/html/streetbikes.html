            <p>Drenched with vintage Electra style, the Women's Amsterdam Classic's steel frame, full fenders, built-in light and 3-speed internal drivetrain with fully-enclosed chain serve up a heaping portion of everyday practicality. While co-workers and passersby coo over your impeccable sense of style, you'll savor the zippy ride, plush saddle, easy-to-use Shimano Revo shifter and included bell.
            </p>
            <div class="bike4"></div>
            <p>Never drop your riding partner again, Cannondale's Road Tandem 3 is fun for everyone! It uses oversize aluminum tubing that's extremely lightweight yet laterally stiff for quickness and stability. Cannondale's Fatty R fork guides you through corners with precision and the burly Mach1 wheels handle miles of riding effortlessly. Shimano's 27-speed drivetrain sports a wide gear range perfect for steep ascents, and flawless shifting, while the Cannondale brakes feature sure-fire braking on the descents. Other great specs include TruVativ cranks, comfy Selle Royal saddles and Vittoria tires.

            <p>Specialized's Dolce Elite provides a light, easy ride you'll love! Its women's-specific E5-aluminum frame with FACT carbon seatstays and precision carbon fork give you an excellent combination of comfort, speed and razor-sharp handling.
            </p>
            <div class="bike5"></div>
            <p>Spin around the neighborhood in stylish comfort with the Townie 3 from Electra! The laid-back aluminum frame, wide tires and plush saddle provide a comfy cruise that's made for lazy afternoons. It also sports Electra's Flat Foot technology that allows you to rest your feet fully on the ground whenever you want. Plus, Shimano's 3-speed drivetrain makes easy work of the hills and the rear coaster brake and front linear-pull brake deliver solid stopping power.

            <p>Times Square, Central Park and traffic jams are all things New York, just like Specialized's Langster of the same name. Its light, responsive A1 Premium aluminum frame and one-speed gearing are ideal for aspiring track racers, urban commuters and for those looking for a bike that is a pure joy.
