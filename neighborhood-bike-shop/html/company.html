        <p class="tune">First, it means top-notch customer service to help you find what you need. Next, it means service training and expertise. Our staff of assembly and repair mechanics is factory authorized for work on most any brand of bike, even if you didn’t buy it from us.
        </p>
            
        <div id="companysub2"></div>
        <p class="tune">One reason our customers like us: Our selection of new bicycles and accessories is one of the best in the area. And if we don’t have what you need, our buying power with all the major suppliers lets us get it for you quickly. You’ll see examples from our selection at this site, and there’s much more in store for you when you visit.
        </p>  
          
        <div id="companysub3"></div>
        <p class="tune">We back every product we sell with our commitment to your satisfaction. If you ever have a problem or are dissatisfied with anything you’ve purchased from us, please see us for a prompt and courteous resolution of the concern. We promise to make it right.
        </p>
        
        <div id="companysub4"></div>
        <p class="tune">It’s fun to be involved in such a health-oriented business, and to offer products that can enhance your enjoyment of cycling. All of us enjoy cycling and helping our customers increase their enjoyment of it as well. So, if you’ve noticed (or heard) that we’re a friendly place to shop, give us a chance to put a smile on your face, too. Stop by whenever you can.
